##  	Traveller Search	## Ref 002
### Status
Pending

### Context
Users should also be able to share their trip information by  allowing targeted people to view the trip.

### Decision
All users are expected to have a unique identifier, we expect to use the email address for this to make the search specific and avoid the overheads of running large searches. The user will be able to enter one or more users which will be allocated permissions to view the trip only. 

### Consequences
If the email address is not known they will need to get this information from the user they wish to share with
