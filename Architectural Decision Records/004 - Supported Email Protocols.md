
##  	Supported Email Protocols	## Ref 004
### Status
Pending

### Context
We need to Poll email looking for travel-related emails. 

### Decision
We are going to use a commercially available IMAP API provider which will allow us to support reading from all mail servers as they all commonly support the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).

### Consequences
There will be a cost for using the commericial APIs and we will be subject to any limitations for reading emails that are applied to a mail box.
