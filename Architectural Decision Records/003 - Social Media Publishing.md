##  	Social Media Publishing	## Ref 003
### Status
Pending

### Context
Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites. We will need to limit the number of API's that we support.

### Decision
We will utilise X, Meta and LinkedIn API's in order to support publishing to Facebook, Instragram, X and LinkedIn.

### Consequences
There may be some users which use less common social media sites which will not be able to use the functionality however by consuming these API's we hope to cover the majority.
