##  	Social Media Publishing	## Ref 003
### Status
Pending

### Context
Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites. 

### Decision
 - We will support publishing to Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn.
 - We will not be exposing links publicly.
 - We will prepare the content at a point in time and provide a link that navigates the traveller to the selected Social Media site.
 - The traveller can then post the prepared content directly on the selected Social Media site.

### Consequences
Because we are not sharing a direct link to the traveller's trip, the information in the Social Media post can become outdated in case of changes on the trip afterwards.
